# Snake Xenia Game
This game was built using C/C++ Win32 APIs and DevC++ IDE for windows. It will work on all windows OS versions greater than Windows XPs3. The game was also ported later to JAVA so that it works on all OSs but this repo does not contain that code.

**Note:** I built this game during the second semester of my engineering course so the project structure is arguably not good. :P.

### Description
The game has two levels and ships with the ability to save the current game, open a saved game, pause the game anywhere and the ability to set the speed of the snake in the game. The highest score is also recorded.

### How to Run?
SImply download or clone the repo and run the Game.exe file. Enjoy!!
Note: The screenshots in this repo are old. The game is way more colorful and better now !!
